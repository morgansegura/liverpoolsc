        payment. If you are travelling with a guest or a Co-Owner, their cruise

      <p>
        You have 24 hours after purchasing your cruise to cancel for any reason
        for a full refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 24 hours, Owners who cancel within the dates shown below for any
        reason, including medical or family reasons, are subject to the
        following cancellation fees:
      </p>
      <p class="tabbed">
        <i class="far fa-circle"></i> 50% of gross fare (applicable to all forms

      <p class="tabbed">
        <i class="far fa-circle"></i> 75% of gross fare (applicable to all forms

      <p>
        Cancellation of an Owner’s Cruise requires, cancellation of the other
        Owner’s Cruise if there are two Owners on the Title; alternatively, it
        requires cancellation of the Owner’s guest’s cruise if there is only one
        Owner on the Title.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, should you use your 2019 Use Term Points to pay for a
        portion of your cruise, your 2019 VOA Dues must be paid in full by
        January 31, 2019, unless you are on a payment plan, in which case you
        must be current at that time. If this obligation is not met, your cruise
        will be cancelled and 100% of gross fare will be lost (including any
        cash or Points). If you are travelling with a guest or a Co-Owner, their
        cruise will also be cancelled without refund.
